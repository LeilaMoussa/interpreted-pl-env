~ This is the low complexity HLPL code ~

() => entry => () [
	~ Entry function is not prefixed with 'func' ~
	~ No parameters or results ~

	var num length.
	var num width.
	var num area.

	~ Call function read which takes no parameters. ~
	length := () => read.
	width := () => read.

	area := mult(length, width).
	~ mult is the reserved word for * operation ~

	~ Print the result through the function call to write ~
	~ Parameter is what is being written ~
